=3.3.5=

==Changes==
* LoRaWAN 1.0.4 (LW1.0.4)
** MAX FCNT GAP check removed
** Join Dev Nonce is incremented with each Join Request sent
** Join App Nonce is validated to increment with each Join Accept received
*** Nonces are reset when AppEUI/JoinEUI is changed
* Added unsolicited result code option AT+URC=1
** Outputs RECV when packet is received
* Added AT+RXO=3 option for EXTENDED_HEX output including dev_addr and fcnt for each payload
* Added multicast setup options
** AT+NA=(1-8),<DEV-ADDR>
** example: AT+NA=1,00112233 - setup multicast dev address
** AT+NSK=(1-8),<NWK-SESSION-KEY>
** AT+DSK=(1-8),<APP-SESSION-KEY>
** AT+DLC=(1-8),<DOWNLINK-COUNTER>
** AT+MCRX=(1-8),(DR0-DR15),(FREQ),(-1-7:PERIOD,-1:CLASS_C)
** AT+JN - Join Nonce counters <DEV-NONCE>,<APP-NONCE>
*** Nonces are saved to flash after each join App Nonce is validated to be incremented from the Join Server per LW1.0.4
** AT+JNV - Enable/disable Join Nonce validation in Join Accept
** AT+REPAIR=1 to erase flash and restore current config settings on mDot
** AT&WP - Save Protected settings available in all firmware
** AT+DI - Protected DeviceEUI can be changed
** AT+NI=2,<EUI> - Set default AppEUI/JoinEUI, value if set will be used as the default AT+NI setting when AT&F is issued
** AT+NK=2,<KEY> - Set default AppKey, value if set will be used as the default AT+NK setting when AT&F is issued
* Pin Outputs
** Join Status available on Associate Pin (mDot:A2, xDot:GPIO0)
** Rx Packet pin is brought high when packet is received, the pin is reset when a new command issued. (mDot:D12, xDot:GPIO1)
*** AT+RECV can be used to retrieve the packet and reset the pin
* FUOTA
** Fragment and Parity indexes changed to start at 1
** McKEKey compatible derivation to unpack multicast session keys
** Session Start Time as GPS time supported
