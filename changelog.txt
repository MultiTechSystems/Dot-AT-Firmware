==4.1.2-mbed-os-6.8.0==

* Increase serial buffer to 512 bytes

==4.1.0-mbed-os-6.8.0==

* Update ChannelPlan_AU915.cpp - add max payload values for DR8-DR13

* XDot - check for external flash only when starting a FOTA session to reduce start-up time.

* Fixed issue where accessing files and sleeping in different threads would cause the MDot to lock up.
* Added AT command to get and set duty-cycle.
* Ability to save a backup of protected settings (Device ID, Network ID, Network Key, and Gen App Key) in MDot One-Time-Programmable storage.
* FOTA session now checks file system for space required to complete file download and upgrade process.  If inadequate space is available files are removed.
* Ability to set trigger for WAKE pin as rising, falling, or either.
* Updated to MBed OS 6.8.
* Support for AS923-4.

==4.0.0-mbed-os-6.1.0==

* LoRaWAN 1.0.4
* Regional Parameters 1.0.3rA

* New AT Commands
**  AT+BTO - Class B Timeout
** AT+CTO - Class C Timeout

* xDot
** Removed some commands and options to reduce firmware size
*** help
*** =? option
*** AT&V
*** AT&S
*** Error details have been removed, only ERROR is returned

* Configuration Updates
** Changes to the configuration are not backwards compatible with previous versions
** A device will lose all configuration and identification if reverted to a previous firmware
** Configuration is saved with redundancy and wear leveling to increase resiliency and allow recovery after write errors due to loss of power or reset during a write cycle

* mDot sleep can be interrupted by LowPowerTimer expiration when RTC_ALARM_OR_INTERRUPT is used.

* xDot now supports FUOTA when an external SPI flash is provided
** Block Device Requirements
*** For a block device to work with the XDot it must meet the following criteria:
**** Work with MBed OS DataFlashBlockDevice or SPIFBlockDevice classes
**** Maximum 4KB sector erase size
**** Maximum 512 byte page size
**** SPIF type components must support Serial Flash Discoverable Parameters (SFDP)

* Updated bootloader
** Supports image manifest allowing full images, compressed images and differential updates
** Firmware image utility available https://pypi.org/project/mtsmultitool/
